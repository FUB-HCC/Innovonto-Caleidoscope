Kaleidoscope is a tool for exploratory analysis of RDF-encoded idea data. It enables you to get an overview over imported
idea texts, and recurring themes within them, by interactively marking concepts used within the idea texts.

If you want to try it, there is a demo running at: https://innovonto-kaleidoscope-demo.herokuapp.com/

## What is Kaleidoscope? What can I do with it?
![Screenshot of the Kaleidoscope Main Interface](docs/screenshot.png)

In our research project [Innovonto](innovonto-core.imp.fu-berlin.de/) we collect large numbers of short text snippets 
containing ideas on how to apply new technologies in everyday products. To make the content of the idea texts computationally accessible,
we asked contributors to annotate key concepts within the idea texts, using an approach we called [Interactive Concept Validation](https://github.com/FUB-HCC/Innovonto-ICV).
**Kaleidoscope** gives a way to make the annotations within a dataset visible: By selecting concepts, you query the idea data and all ideas matching the concept will be
highlighted by the marker you selected (see screenshot above).

This is a re-frame based implementation of the Kaleidoscope Tool for exploratory Analysis of RDF-Data. For more Information
 please have a look at the poster we submitted at UIST 2018:

## Running Kaleidoscope

You will need Leiningen (at least Version 2.7.1).

To run the Server, change into the parent directory and run:
```
    lein run.
```


To run the dev build for the Frontend, run this, in addition to the backend:

```
    lein fig:build.
```


## TODOs
### Backend Functionality
* Right now the ideas/per-marker route is not rest-style, because markers take the form 
"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scenario". Can i somehow improve this?

### Style
 * use same colors
 * toolbox centering

### Frontend Functionality

#### idea-detail view
* describe query for more info?
* annotations (like, rate, tag)
* Text-Annotation
* Created-By

#### CSS Fixes:
* available markers: searhc marker form
* available markers +
* selected markers icon
* selected Markers Toolbar
* cell hover
* cells
* shrink annotations until they fit?


#### Low-Prio
* snapshots
* tabs
* Similar Ideas
* T-Sne + Grid-Mapping Algorithm
* search marker
* Clustering

Indexed Entity pattern

TODO: markers and ideas:

```
    (rf/reg-sub
      :cart-items
      (fn [db]
        (mapv (fn [id]
                {:quantity (get-in db [:cart :quantities id])
                 :item (get-in db [:products id])})
          (get-in db [:cart :order]))))


    {:products {123 {:id 123
                     :name "Bag of holding"
                     :price 40
                     :description "..."}
               ...}
     :cart [{:quantity 2 :item 123} ...]
    
    (rf/reg-event-db
      :update-product
      (fn [db [_ product-info]]
        (assoc-in db [:products (:id product-info)] product-info)))
    
    (rf/reg-sub
      :product-info
      (fn [db [_ product-id]]
        (get-in db [:products product-id])))
```
   
    
### Backend Functionality
* SPARQL Limit ist not respected


#### Endpoints
The endpoints are a wrapper around sparql queries to a sparql endpoint running at
"http://localhost:3030/ac2/sparql".


##### http://localhost:9500/api/all-ideas/
Returns a ResultSet with the following data:

```
    "results": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "idea": { "type": "uri" , "value": "http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/fce9ab17-6ef2-42db-8745-368eeaee99c1" } ,
        "content": { "type": "literal" , "value": "This would be useful for locating and tracking animals on land whom are endangered." }
      } ,
      {
        "idea": { "type": "uri" , "value": "http://purl.org/innovonto/ideas/e3eeb662-c7f7-4631-a979-cfc971012295" } ,
        "content": { "type": "literal" , "value": "tech powered doggy door. Opens the door when it recognizes your pet" }
      }]}
```

##### http://localhost:9500/api/ideas-by-keyword/{keyword}

The backend uses https://github.com/joelkuiper/yesparql to build the sparql queries.

## Development

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein fig:build

This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload. After the compilation process is complete, you will
get a Browser Connected REPL. An easy way to try it is:

    (js/alert "Am I connected?")

and you should see an alert in the browser window.

To clean all compiled files:

	lein clean

To create a production build run:

	lein clean
	lein fig:min

## Backend Only

    lein repl
    (use 'ring.adapter.jetty)
    (use 'hcc.innovonto.kaleidoscope.server)
    (run-jetty handler {:port 3000})

## Testing
TODO: Include Circle CI via lein doo:

lein doo phantom test once && lein cljsbuild once advanced ;; esac:
[lein-doo "0.1.7"]]
http://progjobs.co/ducktype/clj-rethinkdb/commit/a3c417ebfc0dbbe20d4d34ecc0f2691cd94ad659

https://github.com/circleci/frontend
Running the Tests

There are two main ways for running tests using the plugin lein doo. If you wish to run the tests only once, you can do that with

lein doo chrome dev-test once
